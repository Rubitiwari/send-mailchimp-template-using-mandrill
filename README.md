A Mailchimp template can be sent from PHP using Mandrill APIs.

You can push templates from your linked MailChimp account to Mandrill through following these steps.

1-Navigate to the Templates page in your MailChimp account.
2-Locate the template you'd like to copy by browsing the template list or using the search option.
3-Click the template's drop-down menu and choose Send To Mandrill.
4-You'll see a success message once your template has been saved to your Mandrill account.
5-Then integrate "sendmail.php" to send mail.

Note:
If you update your template in MailChimp, you'll need to send the template to Mandrill again to update it. 
Updates aren't pushed automatically.
